## Data Flow

1. **Messages and Events**: Messages and file uploads in Slack are sent to the middleware via the Slack API.

2. **Middleware Processing**: The Node.js middleware service authenticates with Salesforce and forwards events to the appropriate endpoint.

3. **Agentforce Analysis**: The Agentforce agent analyzes content for compliance issues using custom Apex actions.

4. **Compliance Logging**: If issues are detected, the agent logs them as Compliance Incidents in Salesforce.

5. **User Notifications**: The agent sends notifications back to users in Slack through the Slack API.

## Component Details

### Slack Components
- Slack App with Bot User
- Slash Commands
- Event Subscriptions
- OAuth Integration

### Middleware Components
- Node.js Express Server
- @slack/bolt SDK
- JSForce for Salesforce Integration
- Winston for Logging

### Salesforce Components
- Agentforce Agent
- Custom Apex Actions
- Custom Object: Compliance_Incident__c
- REST API Endpoint for Events

## Security Considerations

- All traffic between components is encrypted using HTTPS
- OAuth is used for authentication between systems
- Einstein Trust Layer ensures sensitive data is handled securely
- Incident records are protected by Salesforce's security model
